                <h2>Our history</h2>
                <p>
                    For many years, Bethany has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we opened our
                    first
                    store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the
                    world fell
                    in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... The store became a success
                    in no
                    time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger
                    building.
                    After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order
                    pies
                    from the
                    comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of this:
                    our
                    very own
                    webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!</p>
                <p>
                    Bethany is famous for using only the best ingredients. This way, we can make sure that our pies are
                    absolutely
                    the best.
